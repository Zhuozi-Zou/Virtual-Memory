Analysis:

  In simpleloop.c, the instruction page 0x108000 is accessed 120026 times and the data page 0x1fff000000 is accessed 60100. 
We think the struct krec a is stored in the most accessed data page and the code inside forloop is stored in the most 
accessed instructions page.

  In matmul.c, the instruction page  0x108000 is accessed 46491024 times. We think it might store the for loop indside 
Mat_mult function. It will run n^3 times. data pages 0x1fff000000 and  0x30a000 are accessed  10301223 times and 9040220 times. 
We think viriable A,B,C,n might store in those pages. Cause those virable are all access a lots of time in the multiplication for loop.

  In blocked.c, the instruction page  0x109000 is accessed 45292495 times.  We think it might store the for loop indside 
Blocked_mat_mult function. the data page 0x1fff000000 is accessed 14408843 and the date pages 0x30a000 is ,5083941. 
We think viriable a_p,b_p,c_p,n_bar might store in those pages.
